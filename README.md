This repository demonstrates an uncommon error scenario in Python. The `bug.py` file shows a function that attempts to perform division and handles both `ZeroDivisionError` (division by zero) and `TypeError` (unsupported operand types) exceptions. The `bugSolution.py` file offers the same functionality, but with more specific exception handling in order to improve code readability and robustness. The code examples illustrate how different exception types can occur in similar contexts and the best practices for handling them.
